# Map-Message-Visualizer

An app that tries to parse messages and get where it happened and if people are happy or not then put it on the map.


NOTE: you'll need to provide an API key to goolge maps and googleplaces that you can find at https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios-sdk/

# What it is about
This app uses the google maps on iPhone to display a number of reviews on the map, it tries to parse the feed containing the reviews and predict where they are on the map. You could also add a new review by clicking the (+) button then clicking anywhere on the map and adding the review in the popup that appears.
